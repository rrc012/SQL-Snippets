 Article Name: Searching SQL Server made easy – Searching catalog views
 Create Date:  09-MAR-2016
 Description:  This is a subdivision of scripts into sections based on the objects
               that are being searched and bring it all together at the end into a
			single script that will do the bidding.			             
 Revision History:
 09-APR-2016 - RAGHUNANDAN CUMBAKONAM
			Formatted the code.
			Replaced dbo.sysservers with sys.servers
			Replaced table names in joins and columns with table aliases.
			Added search criteria for Table Types & Types.
			Added the history.

 Usage:		N/A
