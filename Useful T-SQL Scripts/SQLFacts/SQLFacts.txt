SQLFacts
--------

SQLFacts is a tool for conducting research on a SQL Server database. It also serves as a tool for generating documentation of the database architecture.

The SQLFacts SQL file is intended for SQL Server 2012 and newer. There's a disabled block of SQL code to exchange with an active block for use with some prior versions.

SQLFacts Result Sets, The Facts

This fact is a list of schema-level permissions for roles/users.

-- SQLFacts <> 06 Table Details, by name

This fact is a list of tables, with details about associated objects, row counts, and storage requirements.

A value of (0) for PKs means the table has no primary key.

FKs_P contains the number of parents.
FKs_C contains the number of children.

Checks contains the number of check constraints.

From/Plus contains the seed/increment for an IDENTITY column.

GBs_Table contains the space used by the table itself (see table_type).

GBs_Indexes contains the space used by all nonclustered indexes (see Indexes).

-- SQLFacts <> 07 Table Details, by row count

This fact is the same as above, with a different ORDER BY clause.

This fact is a list of table partitions, by schema/object, with details about each partition.

-- SQLFacts <> 09 Partitions (Index)

This fact is a list of index partitions, by schema/object, with details about each partition.

The list includes nonclustered indexes where the partitioning is not aligned with the corresponding table.

The list excludes nonclustered indexes where the partitioning is     aligned with the corresponding table.

This fact is a list of foreign key constraints.

-- SQLFacts <> 14 Check Constraints

This fact is a list of check constraints.

-- SQLFacts <> 15 Triggers

This fact is a list of triggers.

This fact is a list of columns in tables.

-- SQLFacts <> 17 Routine Columns

This fact is a list of columns in routines (views and functions).

-- SQLFacts <> 18 Routine Parameters

This fact is a list of parameters in routines (stored procedures and functions).

-- SQLFacts <> 19 Table/Routine Permissions

This fact is a list of object-level permissions for roles/users.

-- SQLFacts <> 20 Sequences

This fact is a list of sequences, for SQL Server 2012 and newer.

The SQLFacts SQL file must be adjusted to avoid failure when used with prior versions. 

-- SQLFacts <> 21 Synonyms

This fact is a list of synonyms.

-- SQLFacts <> 22 External References

This fact is a list of external references by routines.

-- SQLFacts <> 23 Internal References, by object caller

This fact is a list of internal references between routines.

-- SQLFacts <> 24 Internal References, by object called

This fact is the same as above, with a different ORDER BY clause.

-- SQLFacts <> 25 Table Summary, by name

This fact is a list of tables, with summary information about associated objects and references.

The summary information is weighted and combined to derive an estimate of prominence.

The layer value defines an order for processing that would cause no referential integrity violations.

A value of (-1) for layer indicates the object is involved in a circular reference (self references are ignored).

A series of INSERT operations must be done in layer order, going from low to high.

A series of DELETE operations must be done in layer order, going from high to low.

This fact is the same as above, with a different ORDER BY clause.

-- SQLFacts <> 28 Routine Summary, by name

This fact is a list of routines, with summary information about associated objects and references.

The summary information is weighted and combined to derive an estimate of prominence.

The layer value defines an order for creation that would cause no warning messages.

A value of (-1) for layer indicates the object is involved in a circular reference (self references are ignored).

-- SQLFacts <> 29 Routine Summary, by layer

This fact is the same as above, with a different ORDER BY clause.

-- SQLFacts <> 30 Routine Summary, by estimate

This fact is the same as above, with a different ORDER BY clause.

This fact is a list of potential foreign keys that appear to be valid and do not exist.

-- SQLFacts <> 37 Foreign Key Indexes

This fact is a list of existing foreign keys and their supporting indexes.

A row in the list with NULL values indicates a foreign key with no supporting index.

-- SQLFacts <> 38 Index Redundancy

This fact is a list of pairs of indexes where one index key is a subset of the other index key.

-- SQLFacts <> 39 Questionable Indexes

This fact is a list of indexes with undesirable characteristics, such as wide index keys.
